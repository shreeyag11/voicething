* That Voice Thing

** The Vision
# What is it that we want to achieve
- Make a library that works with frameworks like Vuex and Redux which would execute actions based on user's intent.
  - Make a word index along with associated probabilities for each action
    - Need a list of text, along with the associated intent as a dataset.
    - The word index is generated from this dataset.
  - Give end user's of the library a way to make this word index and "train" the algorithm.
  - Create a way for the library to accept a string as input and return a prediction
- Create a another library that wraps around the webspeech api and turns voice into strings for the first library to accept
  - Have this library generate speech grammer from the word index.
